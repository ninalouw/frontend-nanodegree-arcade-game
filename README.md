#Frogger: frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game
===============================
##Introduction
===============================
This is the third project in the Udacity Frontend Nanodegree course. After completing an introductory course in Javascript and one in Object-Oriented Javascript students are expected to build this classic arcade game using Javascript and HTML5. The app.js file includes the code that I have written, but the engine.js and resources.js files were provided by Udacity.

##Instructions to run the app
===============================
* Download the project [here](https://github.com/ninalouw/frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game)
* Open the index.html file in your browser.

##How to play the game
===============================
* The goal of the game is to get the player to the water and to avoid the bugs.
* If you reach the water your score will increase.
* If you collide with bugs your score will decrease.
* You can move the player using the arrow keys up, down, left and right.
